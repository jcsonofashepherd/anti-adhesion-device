        <div class="simple-text-subtitle first-element">Use of Animal or Human Subjects</div>
        <div class="simple-text-paragraph">This device will eventually be used on human patients undergoing open chest surgery. To that respect, an analog of the human heart must be used to effectively test the device. After the device is determined to fulfill its function, the test on animal heart will be performed. The animal model for this test is pig because the cardiac has a comparable size to that of the human.<br><br>First, the test is planned to perform on a pig heart to evaluate the performance of the hydrogel delivery. After that, the device will be tested on pig open-heart surgery. The tested animals have to be sacrificed after a few months in order to evaluate the performance of the hydrogel. In the final stage, the device will be used in clinical trial only after it is determined to prevent adhesion in the animal trial.</div>
        <div class="simple-text-subtitle">Use of Dangerous Chemicals</div>
        <div class="simple-text-paragraph">The device will utilize an aldehyde-PEG molecule, which is known to be toxic to human tissues. The chemical must be used only in a chemical hoods with the proper PPE. The chemical mentioned can be toxic to the environment as well, so the proper waste management is required to prevent adverse effects on the environment.</div>
        <div class="simple-text-subtitle">Dangerous Mechanical Tools</div>
        <div class="simple-text-paragraph">The 3D printing can be dangerous because it is possible to burn the user if one touches the machine while it is still operating. The 3D printing products sometimes need the raft removed with pliers, which have to be carefully handled to prevent any accidents.</div>
