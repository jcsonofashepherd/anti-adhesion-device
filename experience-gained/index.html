        <div class="simple-text-single">The development of a medical device required the entire team (comprising largely of biotechnology majors) to learn new skills and go through a complete design process at a very expedited pace. Experience gained by the team includes the following:</div>
        <ul class="text-single-list">
          <li>Working knowledge of various engineering software, including SolidWorks and COMSOL. Design of entire device in CAD to be exported for 3D printing and modelling of fluid flow in proposed design. Development of engineering drawings to visually explain parts of the device.</li>
          <li>Development of a Gantt chart and assigning ourselves specific deadlines based off of anticipated bottlenecks.</li>
          <li>Quickly developing alternative designs and combining the best aspects of each alternative design to make one optimal final design. Development of design goals and using a Pugh chart to assess the pros and cons of each alternative design.</li>
          <li>Investigation of existing patents and literature relevant to our problem statement.</li>
          <li>Researching manufacturing resources readily available for use of the team, communicating with various manufacturing parties to inquire about services.</li>
          <li>Interviewing professionals whose input could assist with the design.</li>
          <li>Rapid prototyping making use of 3D printing.</li>
          <li>Developing cost estimates and keeping costs within a set budget; researching ways to save money for project.</li>
          <li>Development of testing protocols (SOPs) making use of NanoDrop device for measuring absorbance, making standards in laboratory environment, and synthesizing substitute solutions for PEG hydrogel components.</li>
          <li>Deliberating attainability of design goals and using the Pareto Principle to determine what goals to cut when needed.</li>
          <li>Writing of full-length design proposal and report.</li>
